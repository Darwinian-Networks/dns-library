We propose a programming library for Darwinian networks (DNs).
The library covers adaptation and evolution in DNs, for modeling a problem domain and inference on the model, respectively.
The implementation uses Python, expanding over a simple constructed BN library called Darwin.
Furthermore, in order to facilitate the interactive with the Darwinian Network Library, a tutorial on IPython Notebook is introduced.
Its benefits includes interactive visual tools to compute and draw DNs ``on the fly.''
Finally, we explore the unit test, a test automation which supports the soundness of Darwinian Network library.
