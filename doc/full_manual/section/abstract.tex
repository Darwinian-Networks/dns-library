We propose a programming library for Darwinian networks (DNs).
The library covers adaptation and evolution in DNs, for modelling a problem domain and inference on the model, respectively.
The implementation uses C++, expanding over a well established BN library called aGrUM.
Furthermore, a wrapper in Python is created over the C++ library, in order to facilitate the development of DN systems with a scripting language.
